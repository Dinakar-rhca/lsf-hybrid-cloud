This repository contains sample code for building two varieties for LSF Hybrid Clouds.

Additional videos that explain how to use this code is posted here:
    { TO be added }

The sample Ansible playbooks will create the LSF Hybrid cluster on AWS.  These playbooks should be taken and customized to meet your specific site requirements.
